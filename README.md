## Introduction

This is a Python-based dexterity game for practicing keyboard typing.

## Development process

### First version
At first, my vision was to push the boundaries of what is possible within the Python terminal. I wanted to design a game capable of handling user inputs in real time, and I succeeded in aligning the game with my vision. Unfortunately, I couldn't replicate the user experience in the deployed 'browser terminal'. I entertained the thought of rebuilding the 'browser terminal' myself, but after some consideration, I decided to avoid getting sidetracked on this project. If you want to try it out in a normal python terminal, simply download the pyton file and run in locally a terminal of your choise.

Here's my 'sketchy' diagrams to envision the foreseen process of this project. The initial sketch is on the **left** and the current 'live' document is on the **right**

## Code

##### Template
- To get the Python console into the browser I used template files provided by Code Institute

##### Third-party libraries <span class="in-line-hint">(listed in the package.json file)</span> 

- xterm 

A library that helps with integrating the terminal into the browser

For manipulating the terminal (moving the cursor, changing colors, etc.) I've been using this cheatsheet by [ConnerWill](https://gist.github.com/ConnerWill) on GitHub
